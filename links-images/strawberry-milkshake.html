        <p>Strawberry milkshake is a refreshing healthy drink to recharge your energy levels. Good for kids as
        well as a breakfast beverage.</p>

        <p>If you get sweet strawberries then its best as we donâ€™t need to add any sugar. Otherwise, add sugar
        as required. You can serve the milkshake plain or add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or strawberry ice
        cream and have a strawberry ice cream shake.</p>
